Hello, Charlie here. Kamal suggested I make a Python mockup of what our programme should be. He wanted an Idea from me an Tahmid that lesson that you missed and said an Incremental game was too simple.

We decided on a Text Based RPG with a menu were you can access 4 modules: Fight, Shop, Hunt, and Exit the game.

Exit is obviously fairly simple but Fight, Shop and Hunt are independent modules and can be programmed individually (we all have to submit some code for the project).

I've made some of the python mockup, Fight, and Exit are already programmed, Shop and Hunt are not. RUN IT, at the very least it should give us all a basic idea of what we're actually trying to produce, we only have 4 weeks so we can't really be changning plans now.

It's not too complicated we'll have to start working on our C++ to code the modules though.

I don't know how to divide up the work, you'll have to decide what modules to take.

UPDATE: 8th of Feb, SHOP now working, only hunt has no functionality. All modules can and should be upgraded.
