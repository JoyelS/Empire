# [F]ight, [E]xit, [S]hop, [H]unt...

Hello, Charlie here. Kamal suggested I make a Python mockup of what our programme should be. He wanted an Idea from me an Tahmid that lesson that you missed and said an Incremental game was too simple.

We decided on a Text Based RPG with a menu were you can access 4 modules: Fight, Shop, Hunt, and Exit the game.

Exit is obviously fairly simple but Fight, Shop and Hunt are independent modules and can be programmed individually (we all have to submit some code for the project).

I've made some of the python mockup, Fight, and Exit are already programmed, Shop and Hunt are not. RUN IT, at the very least it should give us all a basic idea of what we're actually trying to produce, we only have 4 weeks so we can't really be changning plans now.

It's not too complicated we'll have to start working on our C++ to code the modules though.

I don't know how to divide up the work, you'll have to decide what modules to take.

UPDATE: 8th of Feb, SHOP now working, only hunt has no functionality. All modules can and should be upgraded.

UPDATE: 8th of Feb, 'FESH Functional Python3 RPG...'.py is a functional, though very basic Python mockup. It has a few vulnrabilities and is very limited but it the gist of it.

UPDATE: 19th of Feb, Just uploaded a simple C++ file. I think I will try to do the menu system and figure out the relational database. I will help where possible with code integration but you guys need to start producing prototypes for your function/modules - Fight, Hunt and Shop.

UPDATE: 21th of Feb, I've uploaded some code which relates to fighting, it's not perfect yet and so far it only fights a goblin but we can alter the code so that it uses the same code to fight all of the monsters. It's called "FightGoblinTest" have a look at it if you wish and if you find something to improve please let me know. - Joyel

UPDATE: 27th of Feb, Me and sam were looking into improving the fight module which is called for both fight and hunt and I have uploaded a part of it. This new code should be run after the player has chosen the fight option from the menu charlie has made. This new code provides three different attack styles which the player can choose from.

UPDATE: 27th of Feb, I have uploaded part 2 of the code, to run it just put both parts of the code together.
