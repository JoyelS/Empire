# [F]ight, [E]xit, [S]hop, [H]unt...

Hello, Charlie here. Kamal suggested I make a Python mockup of what our programme should be. He wanted an Idea from me an Tahmid that lesson that you missed and said an Incremental game was too simple.

We decided on a Text Based RPG with a menu were you can access 4 modules: Fight, Shop, Hunt, and Exit the game.

Exit is obviously fairly simple but Fight, Shop and Hunt are independent modules and can be programmed individually (we all have to submit some code for the project).

I've made some of the python mockup, Fight, and Exit are already programmed, Shop and Hunt are not. RUN IT, at the very least it should give us all a basic idea of what we're actually trying to produce, we only have 4 weeks so we can't really be changning plans now.

It's not too complicated we'll have to start working on our C++ to code the modules though.

I don't know how to divide up the work, you'll have to decide what modules to take.

UPDATE: 8th of Feb, SHOP now working, only hunt has no functionality. All modules can and should be upgraded.

UPDATE: 8th of Feb, 'FESH Functional Python3 RPG...'.py is a functional, though very basic Python mockup. It has a few vulnrabilities and is very limited but it the gist of it.

UPDATE: 19th of Feb, Just uploaded a simple C++ file, you can not view the code in github, download the file to open it, compile it to run it, it's a simple menu system, pick what modules you want to do and try to implement them. I think I will try to do the menu system and figure out the relational database. I will help where possible with code integration but you guys need to start producting prototypes for your function/modules - Fight, Hunt and Shop.
